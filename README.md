### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on intergrating [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) with Python to automate converting files into [Markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) [here](https://github.com/tmgkopczyk/pysidian). I'm also working on creating a better way to get Weather Data and format it neatly with my [WeatherPy](https://github.com/tmgkopczyk/WeatherPy) project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled at Algonquin College, in the Computer Systems - Technician program.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding the capability of my current projects (repositories here on Github, and some of them are mentioned above)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
